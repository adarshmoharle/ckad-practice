Guess the correct life cycle phase of a Pod

<details>
<summary>The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created.</summary>
Pending
</details>

<details>
<summary>There may be insufficient resources (CPU, memory) on the nodes.</summary>
Pending
</details>

<details>
<summary>The required PersistentVolume is not available or bound.</summary>
Pending
</details>

<details>
<summary>A misconfiguration in the container, such as an incorrect environment variable or command.</summary>
Pending or Failed
</details>

<details>
<summary>A dependency service is not available.</summary>
Running

Expl:
A dependency service being unavailable typically means the container is running but unable to perform its intended functions because it cannot reach a required service. Therefore, the Pod itself might be in the Running phase, but experiencing issues.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Resource limits (CPU/memory) are being exceeded, causing restarts.</summary>
Running

Resource limits being exceeded, causing restarts, can indeed happen while the Pod is in the Running phase. However, if the resource limits are continuously exceeded, the Pod might go into a CrashLoopBackOff state, which is still technically within the Running phase as it involves repeated restarts.
