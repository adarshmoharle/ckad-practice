## What?
### Retrieval Practice is Key
This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to help you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. Unlike passive learning through tutorial videos, these exercises provide active, hands-on practice, enabling you to deeply understand Kubernetes concepts by applying them in a variety of scenarios. This method of learning through retrieval practice is proven to be far more effective for long-term retention and mastery of the subject matter.

Kubernetes exercises that challenge and push your understanding are crucial for effective learning. Currently, there is a shortage of comprehensive Kubernetes tasks available online. This repository aims to fill that gap, offering a wide range of exercises that will test your knowledge and improve your skills, preparing you thoroughly for the CKAD exam.

The exercises in this repository are structured to provide practical hands-on experience with various Kubernetes concepts and components, ensuring that you develop the skills necessary to pass the CKAD exam.

By engaging with these exercises, you'll not only prepare yourself for the CKAD exam but also gain a deeper and more practical understanding of Kubernetes, making you a more proficient developer in real-world scenarios. Happy practicing!
