### Welcome Kubestronaut

We are all in the same boat when it comes to preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. Just like navigating a Kubernetes cluster, we need the right tools and practices to steer our way to success.

## About The Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to help you prepare for the CKAD exam. Many studies show that the best way to learn is through retrieval practiceâ€”actively working on the material by answering questions and solving problems. This method is proven to be far more effective for long-term retention and mastery of the subject matter than passive learning methods like watching videos or reading.

### Structure of the Exercises

The tasks are divided into two main areas:

1. **Curriculum-Focused Exercises:** These tasks closely follow the official exam curriculum and are specifically tailored to prepare you for the CKAD exam.
2. **General Exercises for Kubernetes Primitives:** These tasks cover fundamental concepts that appear across all topics in the curriculum, aiming to train specific "muscle memory."

In creating these exercises, I closely follow the book by Benjamin Muschko, [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Study Guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-kubernetes-application/9781098152857/). This serves as a solid foundation to determine which topics are relevant and which are not.

### Continuous Expansion

The exercises in this repository are continuously expanded, and new exercises are added until a complete set of tasks covering the curriculum is achieved. I am happy to share this knowledge with you and hope it helps in your preparation.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. Whether you're correcting a typo, adding a new exercise, or refining an existing one, your help is appreciated. Please follow the standard fork-and-pull request workflow to submit your improvements.

If these tasks help you, I would appreciate a star for the repository. Your feedback and support are valuable to me.

Good luck with your preparation and happy practicing!
