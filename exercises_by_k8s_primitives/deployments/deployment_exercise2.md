### Task 2:

Create a Deployment with a YAML manifest that meets the following requirements:
1. Specifies labels to the Deployment and its Pods.
2. Declares the container image to be executed in the container of the Pods.
3. Injects one or many environment variables to the container.
4. Specifies the number of ports to expose on the Podsâ€™ IP address.
5. Ensures that 3 replicas of the Pods are running.

The solution can be checked with the following kubectl command:
```bash
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml | grep -E "labels|image|env|ports|replicas"
```
